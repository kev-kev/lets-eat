## Let's Eat

A web app to help you and your partner decide what recipes to make and eat! 

Users can submit recipes to eachother to be added to a shared recipe bank. When a recipe is submitted, it's sent to your partner for them to vote on. Approved recipes get added to your shared recipe bank, while rejected recipes are deleted.
End up not liking a recipe that you've added to your collection? Recipes can still be deleted from your recipe collection after they've been approved.
